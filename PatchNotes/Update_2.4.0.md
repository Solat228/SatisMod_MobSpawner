If you enjoy my work, please consider my [completely optional tip jar](https://ko-fi.com/robb4).

## Fixed Stuff

- Fixed that dedicated server clients would see a ghost fake copy of any spawned creatures if they manually triggered the spawner.

## Extra Info for Modders

The mod has tools to make creating new spawners very straightforward.
This is accomplished via Editor Utility Blueprints.
Check out the source code for an example of how to use them yourself.
You'll have to enable the engine "Editor Scripting" plugin to use them.
