## New Stuff

- Added support for Satisfactory 1.0
- Added [Beetle](https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Beetle) spawner
  - Unlocked with the "Odd Creatures" research node
- Added Elite Crab Hatcher spawner

## Extra Info for Modders

The mod has tools to make creating new spawners very straightforward.
This is accomplished via Editor Utility Blueprints.
Check out the source code for an example of how to use them yourself.
You'll have to enable the engine "Editor Scripting" plugin to use them.
