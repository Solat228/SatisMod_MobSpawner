## Fixed Stuff

- Fixed that Baby Crabs from spawners did not attack the player, instead aimlessly floating around until they expired.

## Extra Info for Modders

The mod has been rewritten to make creating new spawners in the future very straightforward.
This is accomplished via Editor Utility Blueprints.
Check out the source code for an example of how to use them yourself.
You'll have to enable the engine "Editor Scripting" plugin to use them.
